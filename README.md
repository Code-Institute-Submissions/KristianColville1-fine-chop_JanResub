## Technologies & Tools

## Development & Deployment
### Version Control

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [fine-chop](https://github.com/KristianColville1/fine-chop).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

    - git add (name of the file) *This selects the file for the commit*
    - git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)" *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - git push *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### Cloning this Repository

If you would like to clone this repository please follow the bellow steps.

Instructions:

1. Log into GitHub
2. Navigate to the repository you want to clone
3. Click on the green button labelled 'Code'
4. Copy the URL under the HTTPS option
5. Open an IDE of your choosing that has Git installed
6. Open a new terminal window in your IDE
7. Type this exactly: git clone the-URL-you-copied-from-GitHub
8. Hit Enter

You should have a local copy of the repository to use on your machine.

If you encounter problems after cloning this project please make sure you have also installed the requirements to run this project

- Create a virtual environment by running the command in the terminal:
    - **python3 -m venv .venv**

- Activate your virtual environment by running the command:
    - **source .venv/bin/activate**

Please see this [page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) for a comprehensive walk-through and explanation of how to use Git and GitHub if you are unsure how to do so or if you encounter any more problems.

### Heroku

I selected [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) as a deployment option. As of the time of writing, it provides customers with a free tier, allowing them to quickly publish apps if they are just starting as developers

To deploy a project using Heroku follow these steps:

- Log into heroku

![Heroku Login](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-login.png)

- Go to the heroku dashboard

![Heroku Dashboard](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-dashboard.png)

- Create a new app by selecting 'New'

![Heroku New App](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-newapp.png)

- Give your application a name and select a preferred location
    - The EU region was chosen for this application as the developer is located in this region

![Heroku Create App](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-createapp.png)

- Click the 'Create app' button

- If you have config variables in your application
    - Click on settings
    - Click 'Reveal config vars'
    - Input your deployment variables

![Heroku Settings](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-settings.png)

- If you need specific build packs
    - Click on settings
    - Click on build pack
    - Add your packs as needed (Please be aware that the order matters)
    - No specific build packs were selected for this project as Django used.

![Heroku Buildpacks](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-buildpacks.png)

- Once these steps are completed
    - Go to the deploy section
    - Select your version control system
    - For Daily Sync, GitHub was selected

![Heroku Deploy](documentation/readme_folder/heroku-deploy.png)

- Connect your version control system
- Add your repository
- Connect the app selecting 'connect'
